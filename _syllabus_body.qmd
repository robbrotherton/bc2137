### Time, venue & instructor

Tuesday 10:10-1PM, Milbank 410 

Instructor: Dr. Rob Brotherton (<rbrother@barnard.edu>)       
Office hour: Wednesday 10-11AM, Milbank 415M


### Overview

This lab will usually be taken concurrently with BC2138 Social lecture. It will expand upon some of the theoretical, methodological and analytic issues introduced there, as well as giving you the opportunity to explore topics of your choosing from within (or beyond) those covered in the lectures in greater depth through hands-on experience with research design and data analysis.

The semester is broken into 3 projects, each involving an analysis of existing data. The first will involve planning and executing a correlational analysis. The second will involve performing an ANOVA analysis. For the third project, you will design your own analysis. Through these projects you will gain experience in formulating social-psychological research questions; analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing data; and communicating your findings according to the conventions of the field. Projects will be undertaken in small groups; group members will collaborate on design and analysis. Each project will culminate in an in-class group presentation and submission of a brief individual write up of your project.

### Class format & participation

Labs are substantially more interactive and discussion-based than the traditional lecture format, and depend on everyone’s active participation in class discussions and activity as well as group work focused around the projects. Your active participation across the semester will therefore contribute a substantial portion of your grade. 

If you have questions, thoughts, or ideas you want to share, feel free to do so at any time (while keeping within the bounds of polite conversation, obviously--don't interrupt or talk over other people! But do feel free to respond to others without having to raise your hand or wait to be called on). Everyone will get the most out of this lab when the discussion can develop organically and everyone feels free to be part of the conversation if & when they have something to add.

Being part of the in-person discussion is one obvious way to participate, but it’s not the only way. Different people have different styles of participation, and the lab is designed to try and accommodate and encourage different approaches. Your level of engagement with your project partners and Prof. Brotherton as you work through your projects is also an important form of participation. You can also participate by coming to office hours.

At a minimum (i.e. for a passing grade), I’ll be looking for some form of participation (loosely defined) from you every week. Higher participation grades will be earned through regular, enthusiastic, productive participation (note that quality is more important than quantity).



### Workload

As a general rule for the amount of time students should expect to commit to classes, the college suggests three hours per week in or outside of class per credit. Since this class is worth 2.5 credits, that corresponds to 7.5 hours per week, split between time in the classroom and time spent completing the associated assignments (reading, working on analyses, writing reports, etc).



### Final Grades

Your numeric score for the course is a product of your scores for each assignment, weighted as follows:

```{r}
#| echo: false

assignment_weights <- c(
  "Participation (over the course of the semester)" = 10,
  "Presentations" = 30,
  "Reports" = 60
)

knitr::kable(assignment_weights, col.names = "Weight (%)", format.args = )

```


Final grades are determined according to the following boundaries:

    Letter grade:  A+ A  A-	B+ B  B- C+ C  C- D  F
    Numeric score: 97 93 90 87 83 80 77 73 70 60 <60



## Course policies

### Attendance & timeliness

In-person attendance of every lab session is expected, and you should expect to stay for the full duration of the lab. Normally it is departmental policy to remove students who miss more than two lab sessions from the course; however, given ongoing revisions to college-wide health-related policies, exceptions may be made. If you are feeling unwell, you should not come to class and notify me of nonattendance before class if possible.

When you are attending, please arrive on time for class. Frequent lateness will impact your participation grade.


### Assignment late policy {#sec-late-policy}

Presentations will be given in-class on the dates listed in the class schedule. It is expected that all group members contribute equally to the presentation preparation and delivery. Therefore, all group members will receive the same group score, except in exceptional circumstances when it is clear that contributions were not equal. If a group member is unable to present in-person on the day of the presentation due to unforeseen circumstances, please notify Prof. Brotherton. The presentation will be given by the remaining group members, and the absent member may be assigned the group score, assuming equal contributions to the preparation of the presentation.

Written project reports are due one week following the in-class presentation, before the next week's lab session. A grade penalty of 5 points will be applied for each day or part thereof that an assignment is late up to a maximum of 6 days; work not submitted before the next lab will receive a score of zero. For example, if your work is A+ quality but is submitted a day-and-a-half late, you will only receive a B+. This policy is intended to incentivize timely submission while easing the stress of genuine emergencies. When things come up that prevent timely submission you can prioritize accordingly, knowing that a small penalty on one assignment for this lab will not tank your final grade.


### Academic integrity

Students are expected to follow the Barnard Honor Code, available at <https://barnard.edu/honor-code>.

Note that while you will collaborate with group members on the design, analysis, and presentation of research projects, you may not collaborate on the written report: each group member must write their own individual reports. 


### Use of generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT)

Generative AI is an extremely useful tool for many purposes; real researchers are of course using it to help with their research. For this class, you are welcome to use AI tools to help with idea generation, help you understand readings, help formulate your ideas for written reports, etc. However, note the emphasis on *helping* rather than doing things for you. Passing someone else's work off as your own is plagiarism and a violation of the honor code, and that includes the work of AI assistants. AI tools can enhance, but should not substitute for, you own efforts. Please be aware that it is generally obvious when someone has put little thought of their own into their work. Relying on ChatGPT (or similar) to do most of the work for you will result in bad work (and will accordingly earn you a bad grade).



### Academic accommodations and general wellness

It is always important to recognize the different pressures, burdens, and stressors you may be facing, whether personal, emotional, physical, financial, mental, or academic. The faculty and administration recognize this, and are prepared to provide assistance to students in need. I encourage you to seek advice from your advisor, Dean, the [Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS)](https://barnard.edu/disability-services), or [Barnard Health & Wellness](https://barnard.edu/health-wellness) as needed. Please let me know of any issues you wish to share with me that you feel are impacting your ability to complete the course to the best of your ability. Though it isn’t always easy, it is better to proactively seek help rather than letting problems build up.
