# Grading rubric {#sec-rubric}

For each presentation and project report you will receive a score out of 100 according to the rubric below.

Note that presentations will be given jointly. In general, grades will be the same for all group members as it is expected that group members will contribute equally to the presentation; however, exceptions may be made when it is clear that group members did not all contribute equally.

Also note that even though projects will be a group effort, the written reports will be completed individually.
