# Lab 6: Project planning {.unnumbered}

In this lab, you will start your second project: conducting an ANOVA interaction analysis using the same ANES data as before. In this project you'll investigate how political partisanship and life experiences might interact to predict social trust.


### Goals

- Understand the purpose of ANOVA
- Identify variables for your analysis
- Search the literature to find relevant research
- Articulate your hypotheses


## Project overview

### Understanding ANOVA

ANOVA stands for ANalysis Of VAriance; it is a statistical procedure which quantifies the relative contribution of difference sources of variability (variability between groups and variability within groups) to understand whether categorial variables appear to be associated with differences *between* groups over and above what would be expected by chance (i.e, based on the random variability *within* the groups).



#### Dependent variable

You dependent variable should be continuous, that is, measured on a numeric scale. For this project, we will stick with the idea of trust. 

- How often can you trust the federal government in Washington to do what is right? (V201233)
- How many of the people running the government are corrupt? (V201236)
- Generally speaking, how often can you trust other people? (V201237)


#### (Quasi)independent variables

The first of your quasi-independent variables will be some indication of participants' political affiliation. There's a whole literature about ideology and partisanship, and I don't expect you to get into the weeds with it. 

- What political party are you registered with, if any? (V201018)
- Who did you vote for? (V202073)
- If you had to choose, would you consider yourself a liberal or a
conservative? (V201201)

<!-- - Racial identity -->
<!-- - Gender identity -->
<!-- - Partisanship (stated; vote) -->
<!-- - Income -->
<!-- - Age -->
<!-- - Media -->
<!-- - Personal (in)security -->

Your second quasi-independent variable will be one of the "life experiences" that the ANES survey asks about:

  - Do you personally know someone who moved to the U.S. from another country, or not? (V202561)
  - Do you currently owe money on student loans, or not? (V202562)
  - Have you ever received food stamps or another form of public assistance, or not? (V202563)
  - Do you have a pension or a retirement account, such as an IRA, 401k, or similar, or not? (V202564)
  - Do you regularly choose products because they are made in America, or not? (V202565)
  - Have you displayed an American flag on your house or in your yard in the past year, or not? (V202566)
  - Have you gone hunting or fishing in the past year, or not? (V202567)
  - Have you used public transportation in the past year, or not? (V202568)
  <!-- - Have you ever been bitten by a shark, or not? (V202569) -->
