That information is all here in this handbook. This laboratory handbook outlines the procedures, rationales, and techniques for lab exercises, and provides an overview of the accompanying assignment for each week.\nEach lab section contains blank pages for recording notes and for collecting observations. Therefore, you should bring the lab manual to each meeting of the lab.\nYou should skim through this handbook at the beginning of the course so that you have at least a rough sense of what will be required and when, and so you know where you can find relevant information as and when you need it.\nYou’ll find a section for each lab session, giving a brief overview of the main themes and questions for that session, some suggested (optional) additional readings, and any pertinent information about the accompanying assignment.\nYou’ll also find a number of appendices, covering things like searching the academic literature, how to approach reading journal articles, summaries of the basic statistics you should be familiar with, examples of informed consent and debriefing forms, and an extensive guide to writing a lab report.\nI will reiterate much of this information as part of each lab session’s instructional component, and we’ll greatly expand on the themes through the activities I’ll have you do and our collective discussions that follow."

The lab will usually be taken concurrently with PSYC-BC2138 Social Psychology Lecture, and will expand upon the methodological and analytic issues introduced there, as well as giving you the opportunity to explore in greater depth a topic of your choosing from within (or beyond) those covered in the lectures by proposing your own original research project."

    "text": "Class format\nIn the first half of the course you’ll be finding, reading, and summarizing published research papers that may be relevant to your project, and working up a rough proposal. In class we’ll demonstrate and analyze the methodological and analytical approaches commonly employed in social psychological research, giving you the foundation upon which to build your research proposal. In the second half of the course you’ll draft each section of your proposal paper in turn before submitting the final report. In class we’ll focus on refining your proposed methodology and constructing an effective research paper.\nLabs are substantially more interactive and discussion-based than the traditional lecture format, and depend on everyone’s participation. Your active participation across the semester will therefore contribute a substantial portion of your grade. Usually, in-person attendance of labs is mandatory; it is departmental policy to remove students who miss more than two sessions from the course. Given current pandemic-related changes to procedures, that will not be the case for this semester. If you are feeling unwell, you should not come to class. Please notify me of nonattendance before class if possible (as well as reporting symptoms to the college as appropriate).\nBeing part of the in-person discussion is one obvious way to participate, but it’s not the only way. Different people have different styles of participation, and the lab is designed to try and accommodate and encourage different approaches (as well as allowing for the greater-than-usual possibility of missing class for health reasons). In particular, there will be a “Class Collective Lab Notes” Google Doc that everyone in the class will be able to edit; contributions there will constitute class participation just like contributing to the in-person discussion. Your level of engagement with your TA and Prof. Brotherton as you work through your project is also an important form of participation.\nAt a minimum, I’ll be looking for some form of participation (loosely defined) from you every week; higher participation grades will be earned through regular, enthusiastic, productive participation (note that quality is more important than quantity)."

    "section": "The Research Proposal",
    "text": "The Research Proposal\nThe final paper for this lab will be a Research Proposal paper. Producing this will be an iterative process; each assignment will build on the previous ones until by the end of the semester you have a complete research proposal paper.\nYour proposed study can be on any social-psychological topic of your choosing. However, your proposed research should be an extension of previous research, not an exact replication of another existing study, but not an entirely new question either. Proposed studies will use one of the basic methodological approaches that we will cover in the lab this semester or one that you discuss in the lecture. For example, you may propose the development and validation of a new scale (see p. ); a correlational study looking at relationship among constructs (see p. ); or an experimental study manipulating an independent variable and measuring its effect on a dependent variable (see p. ).\nThe project you complete will be a research proposal. You will propose a viable piece of research that could, in theory, be conducted by you or any other researcher—but you won’t actually collect data for it as part of this lab. There are a number of reasons for this. Logistically, to achieve sufficient statistical power (see Appendix C, p. ) social psychological studies often require sample sizes larger than we could feasibly collect as part of this lab. Running an underpowered study is a waste of your and your participants’ time. In addition, merely proposing a study without having to run it allows you to be more ambitious in the kind of research you can propose, which can allow you to explore questions of greater scope and meaning. For students who may be considering a career in academic psychology or another science, proposing studies will be an essential aspect of obtaining grants and fellowships to allow you to conduct that research. Additionally, even beyond the context of obtaining funding for proposed research, recent years have seen a move towards pre-registration of research designs within the field of psychology more broadly. This means creating and publishing a complete plan for your research before collecting the data. We’ll discuss the value of this as part of this and the coming lab sessions. By proposing a study here, you’ll be essentially pre-registering a potential study design.\nA few students each semester mention feeling disappointed not to get to collect data for their project. It’s understandable, but in addition to the issues mentioned above, I’d urge you to think about how much work that would add to the course, and how it would add comparatively little value to your learning experience. Not having to collect data frees us to focus on refining all the details of your study in the limited time we have available, therefore developing a deeper understanding of the crucial issues on which all successful research depends: theoretical, methodological, and interpretative rigor. If you really want to experience collecting and analyzing real data, I’d suggest aiming to run your proposed study as part of an Independent Project in future, for which you can earn 4 to 8 credits depending on whether you complete it over 1 or 2 semesters."

Most assignments are due at 5pm the day after class; exceptions are noted in italics on the schedule. All the assignments relate to your project proposal—the idea is to build this major piece of work incrementally over the course of the semester. The 5pm next-day deadline is necessary to given Prof. B and your TA time to provide feedback to everyone in advance of the next assignment (however, see the next section for late policy).\n\nLate assignments\nAssignments submitted after the deadline but before the next class will receive a grade without penalty; you just need to notify Professor Brotherton in advance that your work will be late. This policy is intended to ease the stress of genuine emergencies and midterm/deadline pile-ups. Knowing when you can reasonably complete work, even if it is not always by the preordained deadline, is part of successful time-management and prioritization. However, be aware that you may not receive timely feedback on late work, and since the lab is designed to build cumulatively towards the final paper, getting behind on assignments may make it hard to catch up and will likely impact your final grade.\nAssignments not submitted before the next class will receive a score of zero. This policy is intended to incentivize timely submission whenever possible, and to reflect the pedagogical value that you miss out on by failing to submit work on schedule; since the assignments for this lab build iteratively on one another, it is essential that you complete them punctually and in order.\n\n\nFinal Grades\nYour final letter grade for the course is a product of your scores for each assignment, weighted as indicated in the class schedule, and determined according to the following boundaries:\nLetter grade: A+ A A- B+ B B- C+ C C- D F Numeric score: 97 93 90 87 83 80 77 73 70 60 <60"

This is one of the most famous studies in the history of social psychology to ostensibly show the power of external situations over individuals’ choices. It’s well known, but not necessarily well understood by people who haven’t studied it in depth. In fact, over the years it has been misconstrued in many psychology textbooks. A detailed discussion and critique can teach us about the approaches, methods, and challenges of psychological inquiry, and the influence of both situations and individuals’ personality and preferences on behavior. It is also revealing about the history and evolution of psychology as a field of research, and the development of ethical guidelines for research with human participants."

Examples include things like aggression, attraction, conformity, obedience, stereotypes, prejudice, credulity.\nThe challenge researchers face is how to measure complex, hypothetical constructs in an objective and quantifiable way. The specific method a researcher decides to use to measure a construct is called the operational definition. Usually there are many possible operational definitions for a given construct. The advantages, disadvantages, and practicalities of various possibilities must be considered when designing research: will participants be willing and able to pay close attention; will they be willing and able to give you accurate and honest answers; is it possible that they could misunderstand what the researcher is asking, or that different participants might interpret the same question or instruction differently; how can researchers attempt to minimize these potential problems?"

We will begin with the simplest type of design, in which researchers simply measure two (or more) constructs and look at how they relate to one another.\nSimple bivariate correlations quantify the extent to which changes on one variable are associated with changes on a second variable (see Appendix C.3.1, p. ). More complicated research might measure a third variable and ask whether it mediates the relationship between the other two; that is, can the bivariate relationship potentially be explained by the influence of a third variable?\nHowever, while correlational techniques can tell us about associations between variables, correlational designs are generally limited in what they can tell us about causal influence.

This Brief Proposal will be the first step: your initial thoughts on what form your proposed research will take. Your proposal will likely not have all the methodological details at this stage, and your thinking may yet change—that’s fine. The main purpose of this brief proposal is to serve as an outline so you can start to figure out the specifics. You’ll get feedback on this which should help you nail down and refine the details moving forward. That said, the more thought you put into this now, the less work you will have to do for the following drafts. This would be a good time to familiarize yourself with Appendix F: Guide to Writing Lab Reports (p. ), if you haven’t already, as that is what this is building towards.\nYour brief proposal should include:\n\nTitle Page\n\nSame as the previous assignment, unless you’ve changed your approach enough to require a change of title\n\nLiterature review\n\nInclude your lit review from the previous assignment, with any changes (if you’ve made them)\n\nMethod -State the basic design format of your proposed study—is it a scale design study, a correlational design, or an experiment? State any constructs you plan to manipulate or measure\n\nFor each construct, state your operational definition (i.e. how you actually plan to manipulate or measure the psychological constructs)\n\nAnalysis\n\nWhat is your fundamental analytic approach? Is this a correlational study where you’re looking for associations between variables, or an experimental study in which you’re looking for differences between randomly-assigned groups, or a quasi-experimental study in which you’re looking for differences between pre-existing groups? What is it, in a nutshell, that you expect to find?\n\nReferences\n\nInclude an APA-formatted reference for each study you cite"

    "section": "Key ideas",
    "text": "Key ideas\n\nStyle and contents of an APA Introduction section\nHow to frame previous findings to create a coherent and compelling justification\nAPA style for citations & references\n\nBy now, you should have settled on your proposed design (though you may still be refining the details in response to collaboration with your partner(s) and guidance from Prof. Brotherton and your TA). Now you will begin to draft your complete lab paper, one section at a time. Instruction in class this week will focus on writing good APA-style Introduction section.\nThere are two major components of APA style. First, there are the nitty-gritty aspects of formatting the document itself, such as how to format the title page, running head, headings of different levels, figures, page numbers etc. The APA produces a manual which details exactly how to do this. However, the conventions change from time to time; the APA style guide is now in its 7th edition, published in October 2019. Because these formatting conventions are arbitrary and subject to change, I see them as relatively unimportant for our purposes. If you won’t be writing any more psych research articles, it’s not worth your time learning this stuff; if you will then you’re better off just using a current template when starting your documents—word processors like Word and Google Docs offer such templates built-in. I will make a Google Doc template specially tailored for this lab available.\nOne exception, however, is for citations and references. Since you are writing a scientific document based on existing research, it is important to cite that existing research according to the conventions of the field so that your sources can easily be checked by any interested reader. So while you can largely ignore fiddly formatting details, you will have to make an effort to use the correct citation style (or let a reference manager app like Zotero do the work for you; see Appendix B.\nThe second component of writing an APA-style research article is the content. For our purposes this is much more important than arbitrary formatting rules. You must ensure that all the expected content is present in your work; that unneeded content is not present, so as not to distract or take away from the clarity and coherence of your writing; and that it is communicated in the tone expected of a psychological research article. The assignment description for each draft section will give an outline of required content, and you will find more advice and tips in Appendix F: Guide to Writing Lab Reports (p. )."

    "text": "Assignment\nYou will submit a draft of your Introduction section. This will be based on the literature review you have already written, but it may require some changes of emphasis, style, and structure. The general structure of a good APA-formatted Introduction is as follows:\n\nThe first paragraph should introduce your broad area of research, emphasizing why it is a question of interest to psychologists, and, in a few sentences, summarizing the gist of existing research and how your proposed study would add to our understanding of social psychology.\nThe main body of the Introduction is your literature review. Identify current theories relevant to the topic at hand, and present an overview of the findings of other researchers who have tried to answer similar questions.\n\nYou should include at least 4 existing studies that relate to your question.\nThey may or may not all require the same depth of description—e.g. if your methodology is very close to a particular previous study, it would require a more thorough description than a previous study for which the methodology is less directly relevant to your project.\nThe key is to make this a logically-flowing argument rather than a simple list of studies. Make sure each paragraph focuses on a single theme (which might be one study or more than one related study), and that each paragraph also transitions from and to the next by pointing out how the studies/theme relates to the others, and how they contribute towards your own research proposal.\n\nThe last paragraph should briefly sum up your literature review, and state the question you are trying to answer. What are your specific hypotheses or expectations?\nYou should be framing this as a gap in the literature you just outlined, or a necessary extension of some existing study."

Two minutes is not a lot of time. Apparently, people speak at a rate of around 125 to 150 words per minute on average. So a 2-minute presentation will be no more than around 300 words. The single-slide, not-many-words format demands clarity, conciseness, and being bold to spark the audience’s interest in your topic.\nAvoid simply reading excerpts from your paper. That would be boring, and would probably take up too many words. Make it fun and interesting. Try to grab the audience’s attention and hit them with just the most important points of your ideas.\nYou will also have a single PowerPoint slide to accompany your presentation. Make it count. You can’t just cram a load of text on there, because nobody will be able to read it. Plus, it’d distract from what you’re saying. Make it a visual aid that somehow supports or clarifies what you’re saying. It might be a visual representation of your design, a key piece of your experimental stimuli, a graph of your expected results, or just a pertinent meme which conveys the motivation for your question.\nAfter your two-minute talk you’ll take a few questions from the audience, and your responsiveness will contribute toward your grade as well as the quality of your presentation itself (remember a perfectly acceptable answer if often: “Good question; I don’t know the answer!”). It’s not usually an issue, but just in case your audience is left speechless, I suggest coming with a couple of questions or thoughts of your own that you can throw at the audience to spark more questions.\nEach pair will be allotted five minutes total for their talk and Q&A. Going over time and/or failing to leave time for questions will impact your presentation grade. It is up to each pair to decide how to divide up the two-minute talk, and to practice to make sure the presentation is to time."

This is an Ovid database in which you do sequential searches and then combine them with the Boolean operators AND and OR – see tinyurl.com/barnard-boolean-guide. If “Map Term to Subject Heading” is checked, PsycINFO will show you a list of subjects related to the keyword you entered, which can help you to narrow down your search to articles that are actually on the topic you’re interested in (rather than just containing the keyword). Click on the word “Expand” on the right hand side of the search screen if you can’t see all your previous searches. Another database to try if PsycINFO doesn’t cut it: Web of Science.\nStep 7. Managing your References\nWhen you are dealing with a large number of references or multiple papers, I recommend using Zotero to assist you. It is a free application with a browser plugin to collect article details as you are searching the literature. When you’re on a website looking at a journal article, the Zotero browser add-on allows you to click a button to automatically download the article details into Zotero (including, if available, a PDF of the article). This allows you to keep track of all the articles you have found. Installing Zotero also installs a Word plugin that allows you to insert citations in-text and automatically generate a complete, APA-formatted references section.

Of course, you could just list the individual observations and try to form an intuition about the general outcome, but there are more formal means to determine whether the experimental manipulation had an effect. A statistical description summarizes the data in a way that permits interpretation.\nNote that even though you will be proposing a piece of research and not actually collecting or analyzing data, familiarity with the following statistical concepts and procedures will be essential for you to propose an appropriate analysis for your proposed design, and for you to meaningfully interpret the potential results of such a design."

    "text": "Descriptive statistics\nThe first step is to describe your data. These kinds of statistics are called descriptive statistics or summary statistics. With an experimental design where you want to compare groups, the most obvious place to start is to find an average value for the observations in a group. The average, or mean, is a measure of typical performance; it summarizes all the scores and produces a single number which represents the most typical value. The basic formula for the mean of a set of scores is:\n\\[\nM = \\dfrac{\\Sigma X}{n}\n\\]\nIn this equation, \\(X\\) refers to all the scores in the group, and n is the number of scores in the group. The symbol \\(\\Sigma\\) instructs you to sum all the scores. A simple way of saying the formula in words is: Add up all the scores in the group and divide by the number of scores in that group. If you experiment involves comparing two or more groups, you can obviously calculate the mean of each group of scores separately. If the means are different, maybe your experimental manipulation had an effect.\nHowever, there is always variability in the scores in a group. The mean is a central value, but some scores fall below it and others above it. Therefore, researchers also need to describe the amount of variability in scores. This puts the mean in context, describing just how representative of all the scores it is. If there is high variability, scores are spread widely and the mean is relatively unrepresentative; if there is low variability, scores are clustered tightly and the mean is relatively representative. When variability is high, the group means might be different just due to chance, not because of your experimental manipulation.\nA mathematical way of describing the amount of variability in a group of scores is to calculate the deviation of each score from the mean, square the deviations, and then sum the squared deviations. This quantity is called Sum of Squares (SS). One mathematical formula is:\n\\[\nSS = \\Sigma(X - M)^2\n\\]\nDividing SS by the number of scores in the group minus 1 produces a quantity called variance, which is represented by the symbol s2. Variance is the average squared deviation. (Remember that to calculate an average, you add a set of scores and divide by n. Here we add a set of deviations and divide by n – 1. We use n – 1, rather than just n, because it is a necessary statistical adjustment to account for the fact that samples tend to underestimate variability.)\n\\[\ns^2 = \\dfrac{\\Sigma(X-M)^2}{n-1}\n\\]\nTaking the square root of the variance produces another quantity, called standard deviation. It is represented mathematically by the symbol s, but in psychology papers you will most often see it represented by the letters SD.\n\\[\nSD = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\Sigma(X-M)^2}{n-1}}\n\\]\nWhile variance is the average squared deviation, SD is the average deviation in the original units (i.e. not squared). This is the most intuitive way to convey how much scores typically varied about the mean."

    "text": "Inferential statistics\nKnowing the standard deviation and mean for each experimental group gives you a good idea of how much scores differed within each group, and how much the groups differed on average. But researchers still need to perform a statistical test to determine whether the groups differed more than would be expected by chance alone. These kinds of statistical tests are called inferential statistics, because we are using our sample data to make an inference about what would happen if everyone in the population had taken part in our experiment, rather than just the small number of people who happened to be in our samples.\n\nCorrelation\nWhen you measure two variables and wish to know if scores on one measure are related to scores on the other, you calculate the correlation coefficient. This quantifies the extent to which changes on one measure are related to changes on the other. For example, if higher scores on measure X are associated with higher scores on measure Y, there is a positive correlation. If higher scores on measure X are associated with lower scores on measure Y, there is a negative correlation. No correlation means that scores on X are unrelated to scores on Y.\nTo calculate the correlation between two variables, you must first calculate the Sum Product, SP. The mathematical formula is:\n\\[\nSP = (X-M_X)(Y-M_Y)\n\\]\nNotice that X-MX and Y-MY are deviation scores, just like we calculated for the standard deviation. Here we have two variables, X and Y, so the equation is telling us to calculate the deviation of each score from its respective mean. We then multiply each deviation for variable X by its counterpart deviation from variable Y. These are the “products,” meaning multiplied deviation scores. Finally, the tells us to add up all those products, giving the “sum of products,” SP Once we have calculated SP, the correlation coefficient, symbolized by r is calculated using the following equation:\n\\[\nr = \\dfrac{SP}{\\sqrt{SS_X SS_Y}}\n\\]\nHere, SSX and SSY are the Sums of Squares for each variable. Multiplying them and taking the square root gets us a measure of the variability in X and Y separately. The numerator, SP, represents the covariability of X and Y. So the equation results in covariability as a proportion of all variability. It can range from -1, meaning a perfect negative correlation, to 0, meaning no correlation at all, to +1, meaning a perfect positive correlation. As a rule of thumb, in psychology, correlations of less than around ±0.30 are considered weak, around ±0.30 to ±0.70 are considered moderate, and greater than around ±0.70 are considered large.\n\n\nThe \\(t\\)-test\nOne test to compare two groups of scores is the t-test. One form of the t-test formula, assuming that the two groups have equal sample sizes, is as follows:\n\\[t = \\dfrac{M_1-M_2}{\\dfrac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\\dfrac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\\]\nThe numerator is simply the difference between the group means (the different group means are represented by the subscripts \\(1\\) and \\(2\\)). The denominator quantifies how much of a difference is to be expected due to chance alone. It divides each group variance (\\(s^2\\)) by the number of scores in that group, adds the answers, and then takes the square root.\nThe size of the t statistic required to conclude that a difference between groups is real depends on the size of the samples (how many observations you took). The greater the number of observations, the smaller the t required to identify a real difference. In order to determine the exact value of \\(t\\) required to declare the difference in groups to be reliable, several values must be determined. One of these is the degrees of freedom for the test (\\(df\\)).\nThe degrees of freedom, df, is another statistical correction that weights the number of observations in each experimental group. Basically, we lose one degree of freedom for each group, so with two groups, \\(df = N – 2\\) (\\(N\\) being the total number of scores), or:\n\\[df=(n_1-1)+(n_2-1)\\]"
