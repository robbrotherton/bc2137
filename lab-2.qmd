# Lab 2: Project Planning {.unnumbered}

## Key ideas

-   Searching the literature
-   How to read a research paper
-   Beginning to decide on an appropriate research question

This session is about looking ahead to what your lab paper will consist of and starting to lay the foundations. We'll cover critical skills, including how to search the psychological literature to find existing research relevant to your interests (see [Appendix @sec-searching]<span class="exclude-from-html">, p. \pageref{sec-searching}</span>) and how to skim papers to quickly determine whether they are worth spending your time on and how to read them to get the most out of them (see [Appendix @sec-reading]<span class="exclude-from-html">, p. \pageref{sec-reading}</span>). We'll also practice coming up with viable hypotheses to test social psychological questions.

## Assignment

Your assignment this week is to write a short summary of a published research paper that may be relevant to your project proposal. You may later decide to go in a different direction and that the paper isn't actually relevant: that's fine. The point is simply to begin discovering the kind of research other people have done on the topic you are interested in and to use it as inspiration to gradually start forming the idea for your own novel research proposal, which should build incrementally on what has been done before.

You'll post your summary publicly in the Canvas discussion thread---the idea being that other people might also find that paper relevant and worth reading, so we'll collectively be discovering and sharing a wide variety of research.

To get the best possible grades for these summaries (note that your grade and feedback will, of course, be private), you should be writing concise, detailed and thoughtful summaries, spending up to about an hour and a half to submit your best work possible. Your summary should be less than a page (no more than 400 words or so), briefly outlining the paper's:

-   Background (what did the researchers base their approach on?)
-   Method (what did the researchers do?)
-   Results (what did they find?)
-   Conclusions (what conclusions did they draw?)
-   Strengths/limitations (what are the major strengths and limitations of the study, in your view?)
-   Relevance to your thinking/ideas for how you could extend upon this research (what does this add to your thinking as far as the research proposal goes?)

You'll receive a score and feedback based on the following rubric (again, even though you'll post your summary publicly, your grade and feedback will be private to you, provided via SpeedGrader in Canvas).
