# Lab 10: Proposal planning {.unnumbered}

My hope is that at this point you are feeling a sense of accomplishment at what you have achieved through the secondary data analysis projects so far, but that you're also feeling a bit limited by choice of variables you had and the inability to decide what exactly to measure or how to measure it. In this lab we'll begin the final project: devising and piloting a novel measure of a personality trait of your choice.


## Goals

- Understand the process of scale design and validation
- Pick a personality trait to design a scale around
- Write a brief proposal of your project and expectations
