# Lab 10: Project planning {.unnumbered}

My hope is that at this point you are feeling a sense of accomplishment at what you have achieved through the secondary data analysis projects so far, but that you're also feeling a bit limited by the constrained choice of variables you had. In this lab we'll begin the final project: you will execute a project of your own design, with the freedom to choose any variables you like from the full data set.


## Goals

- Decide on an analysis and identify the relevant variables
- Start preparing the data in R
