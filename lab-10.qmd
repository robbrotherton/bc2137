# Lab 10: Project planning {.unnumbered}

My hope is that at this point you are feeling a sense of accomplishment at what you have achieved through the secondary data analysis projects so far, but that you're also feeling a bit limited by the constrained choice of variables you had. In this lab we'll begin the final project: you will execute a project of your own design, with the freedom to choose any variables you like from the full data set.


### Goals

- Decide on an analysis and identify the relevant variables
- Find some relevant research
- Articulate your hypotheses



## Project overview

### Decide on your constructs/operational definitions

Suggestions:

- Feeling thermometers
- Political knowledge
- Media consumption
- Authoritarianism
- Stereotypes
- Policy positions
- Conspiracy beliefs
- Religiosity


### Find relevant research

At least 1 paper.


### Articulate your hypotheses
